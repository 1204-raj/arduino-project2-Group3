## Project Description
This project is about creating a sequence of blinking LEDs using Arduino Uno and a breadboard.  
The circuit uses 6 LEDs of different colors connected through resistors to Arduino digital pins (D2–D7).  

## How It Works
- Each LED is connected to a digital pin via a resistor.  
- The Arduino code turns the LEDs on and off in sequence with delays.  
- The cathodes (–) of all LEDs are connected to a common ground (GND).  

## Pin Connections
| LED | Arduino Pin |  
|-----|------------|  
| LED1 | D2 |  
| LED2 | D3 |  
| LED3 | D4 |
